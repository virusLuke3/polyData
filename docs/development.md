# Development

This page documents stable public development commands for polyData.

## Frontend

```bash
cd webpage
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

The Vite dev server defaults to port `3000`. API proxy requests use `/wm-api`
and target `VITE_POLYDATA_API_BASE_URL` when set, otherwise
`http://127.0.0.1:18500`.

Production frontend deployment is expected to publish `webpage/dist` from CI,
not build on the remote server.

## API

```bash
python scripts/api_server.py --help
python scripts/api_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18500
```

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18500/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:18500/system/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:18500/bootstrap
```

## Local systemd runtime

Public systemd templates live in `deploy/systemd/`.

Typical commands:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now polydata.target
systemctl --user status polydata-api polydata-market-sync polydata-trade-sync polydata-oracle-sync polydata-analytics-sync
journalctl --user-unit polydata-api -f
```

Shared runtime configuration is read from `~/.config/polydata/polydata.env`.
On shared servers, enable lingering so the services keep running after logout:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

## Convenience Commands

The root `Makefile` wraps existing commands without changing their behavior:

```bash
make web-build
make api
make dev
make status
```

`make dev` uses `scripts/start_dashboard.sh`, which starts the API only and
prints the frontend command to run separately.

## Refactor Safety Checklist

- Keep `scripts/start_dashboard.sh` working as a local API helper until a better
  replacement is proven.
- Keep `scripts/api_server.py` working as the compatibility API entrypoint.
- Run `cd webpage && npm run build` after frontend or shared type changes.
- Avoid committing runtime data, logs, private docs, or generated dependency
  directories.
